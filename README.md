PROPOSED COMMON MVC INTERFACES
==============================

This project is the start of a set of potential common interfaces to utilize
between various frameworks. The initial goal is to agree on standard interfaces
for describing Request and Response objects, as well as objects they compose.

Current work is based on research Matthew Weier O'Phinney has done for the Zend
Framework 2.0 MVC, as well as work currently in progress on Symfony 2 by Fabien
Potencier.
